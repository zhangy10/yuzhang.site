I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in School of Computing at [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/), Sydney, Australia. I am supervised by [Prof. Tao Gu](https://taogu.site/). I obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/), and B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Southwest University for Nationalities, and experienced M.Eng. in Distributed Computing from [the University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) from 2015 to 2016. I am a member of ACM and IEEE.



My long-term research goal aims to explore innovative ways of smart sensing and embedded AI to facilitate the building of novel applications. My research interests broadly lie in [Cyber-physical Systems]() in the field of Mobile Computing, On-device Machine Learning, Wireless Sensor Network, Embedded AI, Internet of Things, and Big Data Analytics. I was also a Senior Software Engineer with solid working experience in IT industry. Please visit the below reserch profile page for more details. We mainly publish our work in journals and conferences, including [ACM/IEEE ToN](https://dl.acm.org/journal/ton), [IEEE JSAC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=49), [IEEE TMC](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tm),  [MobiCom](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2021/), [SenSys](http://sensys.acm.org/2020/), [UbiComp](https://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2020/), [IPSN](https://ipsn.acm.org/2020/), and [INFOCOM](https://infocom2020.ieee-infocom.org/).
